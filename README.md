# DETECTION-AND-CHARACTERIZATION-OF-DDOS-ATTACKS-USING-TIME-BASED-FEATURES

A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. DDOS attacks accomplish this by flooding the target with traffic or sending it information that triggers a crash. The project was done by a group of three including me. 


My contribution was development, resource gathering, and making project reports.  This project was developed in Python which is one of the best for machine learning projects and I have used an online free dataset to run the tests. Gaussian Naive Bayes Method and Adaboost Classification method are very suitable methods for analysing the data, a comparison graph is generated. In the last step, a heat map is generated which shows which type of DDoS attack will be most likely to be used by the attacker. In this process, I have learned how the machine learning modules work how they define the solution for the data, and how to manage a team while doing the project I faced issues by which I learned how to tackle the problem and resolve it.

I have uploaded the project video for the reference
